# Reporting Security Issues

The ("Standard Library") project team and community take security bugs in
the ("Standard Library") project seriously.
We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make
every effort to acknowledge your contributions. Pursuant thereto, and contingent
on the notability of the issue and the availability of monetary resources, we
may offer a reward for the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

The ("Standard Library") project team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep
you informed of the progress toward a fix and full announcement and may ask for
additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

Thank you for keeping the ("Standard Library") project and its community safe.
